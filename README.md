# ✨ Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization
We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. We investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose **G**radient-**P**reserving clipping **P**olicy **O**ptimization (**GPPO**) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens.

## 📌 Overview

<div align="center">
<img src="./docker/main_result.png" width="100%"/>

<sub>Benchmark accuracy of Klear-Reasoner-8B on AIME 2024/2025 (avg@64), LiveCodeBench V5 (2024/08/01-2025/02/01, avg@8), and v6 (2025/02/01-2025/05/01, avg@8).</sub>
</div>

Klear-Reasoner is an 8-billion-parameter reasoning model that achieves **SOTA** performance on challenging **math and coding benchmarks**:

| Benchmark | AIME 2024 | AIME 2025 | LiveCodeBench V5 | LiveCodeBench V6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Score** | **90.5 %** | **83.2 %** | **66.0 %** | **58.1 %** |

The model combines:
1. **Quality-centric long CoT SFT** – distilled from DeepSeek-R1-0528.
2. **Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO)** – a novel RL method that **keeps gradients from clipped tokens** to boost exploration & convergence.

## 🧪 Training
### Configure the experimental environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suu990901/Klear_Reasoner.git
cd Klear_Reasoner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For the code, we use [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail) for the **sandbox** environment. Additionally, we implemented multi-process control based on [Pebble](https://github.com/noxdafox/pebble), which allows us to reclaim all resources allocated to a task when execution times out. For mathematics, we use [math_verify](https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify) for judging.

### Using Ray for Multi-Node Training
For multi-node training​​, ensure ​​all nodes are started and connected via Ray​​ before executing the training script. Below is a brief setup guide for Ray across multiple machines:
#### Step 1: Start Ray on the Head Node (node0)

On the first node (typically called `node0`), run:

```bash
ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0
```

Get the IP address of the master node.
```bash
MASTER_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
```
#### Step 2: Connect Other Nodes (e.g., node1)

On each additional worker node (e.g., `node1`), run the following, replacing the IP with that of your head node:

```bash
ray start --address=\"$MASTER_IP:6379\"
```

### RL Training
Run the following script on the master node to start the training task.

```bash
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_math.sh # For Math RL
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_code.sh # For Code RL
```

In the startup script, you need to set the following variables:
```bash
YOUR_MODEL_PATH="<your_model_path>"
CKPTS_SAVE_DIR="<ckpts_save_path>"
YOUR_TRAIN_FILE="<train_data_path>"
YOUR_TEST_FILE="<test_data_path>"
```

<!-- ## 🔍 Key Techniques
| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| **GPPO** | Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization. Retains clipped-token gradients; stabilizes training while boosting exploration. |
| **Soft Reward** | For code tasks, reward = (passed tests / total tests) instead of binary 0/1. |
| **Zero-Advantage Filtering** | Removes prompt groups whose advantages are all zero → clearer gradients. |
| **YaRN Extension** | Extends context to 64 K tokens during inference for better long-CoT reasoning. | -->
