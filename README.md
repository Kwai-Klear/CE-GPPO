# ‚ú® Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization
We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. We investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose **G**radient-**P**reserving clipping **P**olicy **O**ptimization (**GPPO**) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens.

## üìê GPPO (Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization)

GPPO is a **plug-and-play** replacement for PPO/GRPO that keeps the clipped tokens **in the computational graph** and lets their gradients flow in a **bounded, controlled** way.


### Problem with Vanilla Clipping  
Classic importance-ratio clipping (PPO/GRPO) drops all tokens whose ratio  
$r_t^{(j)}=\pi_\theta/\pi_{\text{old}}$ falls outside $[1-\varepsilon_l,\ 1+\varepsilon_h]$.  
Two side-effects appear:

- **High-entropy exploratory tokens** (large $r$, positive advantage) are killed ‚Üí less exploration.  
- **Negative trajectories** (small $r$, negative advantage) are ignored ‚Üí slower correction.


### GPPO Surrogate Loss (Token-Level GRPO)  

Let  
- $\delta = r_t^{(j)}(\theta)=\pi_\theta/\pi_{\text{old}}$ (importance ratio)  
- $\tilde A^{(j)}$ = group-relative advantage  
- $\text{sg}(\cdot)$ = stop-gradient (detach from back-prop)

The **GPPO objective** is  


![GPPO Loss](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn.svg)


- **Forward**: behaves exactly like Clip-Higher.  
- **Backward**: the fraction $\frac{1\pm\varepsilon}{\text{sg}(\delta)}$ keeps the clipped magnitude **but still propagates** a mild gradient.


### Gradient Expression  

Let $\phi_\theta(a_{j,t},s_{j,t})$ be the policy-gradient vector.  
The **per-token gradient** is  

![gard](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn_1.svg)


where  

![condtion](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn_2.svg)

- **Never zero** ‚Üí every token contributes to learning.


### General Form with Tunable Scaling ($\beta_1$, $\beta_2$)  

For finer-grained control:  

![general_loss](https://github.com/suu990901/KlearReasoner/blob/main/docker/CodeCogsEqn_3.svg)

Empirically we set $\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 1$.

<sub>Comparison of GPPO, GRPO w/ Clip Higher, and CISPO in mathematical RL training. Both methods are trained from an earlier long-CoT SFT checkpoint with a sequence length of 32K tokens. For GRPO, we use the Clip-Higher strategy from DAPO with the recommended $$\epsilon_h = 0.28$$.</sub>

## üß™ Training
### Configure the experimental environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/suu990901/Klear_Reasoner
cd Klear_Reasoner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For the code, we use [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail) for the **sandbox** environment. Additionally, we implemented multi-process control based on [Pebble](https://github.com/noxdafox/pebble), enabling automatic resource reclamation upon task timeout. For mathematics, we use [math_verify](https://github.com/huggingface/Math-Verify) for judging.

### Training Data Format
Please refer to the format of the two provided datasets, [Math RL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Suu/KlearReasoner-MathSub-30K) and [Code RL](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Suu/KlearReasoner-CodeSub-15K), for the training data. The format for a single math entry is as follows:  
```json
{"data_source": "math_longcot_math_verify", "prompt": [{"content": "Let $n=9867$. If you calculated $n^{3}-n^{2}$, what would be the unit digit found?\n(a) 0\n(b) 2\n(c) 4\n(d) 6\n(e) 8", "role": "user"}], "ability": "math", "reward_model": {"ground_truth": "4", "style": "rule"}, "__index_level_0__": "29999"}  
```
  
Here, the data_source field is set to "math_longcot_math_verify".  

The format for a single code entry is as follows:  
```json
{"hash": "47c43857280be8a7557cc36b998b3012", "ability": "code", "data_source": "coder1_longcot", "prompt": [{"content": "You are an expert Python programmer. You will be given a question (problem specification) and will generate a correct Python program that matches the specification and passes all tests.\n\nTakahashi is planning to eat N dishes.\nThe i-th dish he plans to eat is sweet if S_i = sweet, and salty if S_i = salty.\nIf he eats two sweet dishes consecutively, he will feel sick and be unable to eat any more dishes.\nDetermine whether he can eat all the dishes...", "role": "user"}], "reward_model": {"ground_truth": "...", "style": "rule"}}  
```

Here, the data_source field is set to "coder1_longcot".

**The data_source field affects the choice of verifier.**

### Using Ray for Multi-Node Training
For multi-node training‚Äã‚Äã, ensure ‚Äã‚Äãall nodes are started and connected via Ray‚Äã‚Äã before executing the training script. Below is a brief setup guide for Ray across multiple machines:
#### Step 1: Start Ray on the Head Node (node0)

On the first node (typically called `node0`), run:

```bash
ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0
```

Get the IP address of the master node.
```bash
MASTER_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
```
#### Step 2: Connect Other Nodes (e.g., node1)

On each additional worker node (e.g., `node1`), run the following, replacing the IP with that of your head node:

```bash
ray start --address=\"$MASTER_IP:6379\"
```

### RL Training
Run the following script on the master node to start the training task.

```bash
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_math.sh # For Math RL
bash recipe/dapo/perf_run_dapo_ours_code.sh # For Code RL
```

In the startup script, you need to set the following variables:
```bash
YOUR_MODEL_PATH="<your_model_path>"
CKPTS_SAVE_DIR="<ckpts_save_path>"
YOUR_TRAIN_FILE="<train_data_path>"
YOUR_TEST_FILE="<test_data_path>"
```

### Evaluation
When we expand the inference budget to 64K and adopt the YaRN method with a scaling factor of 2.5. **Evaluation is coming soon, stay tuned.**
